This is my responsive portfolio site created with ReactJS and plain CSS that implements EmailJS for contact services.

Source Code is uploaded to the Master Branch of this Repository, and the hosted version of the code is then uploaded to the gh-pages branch.

## **Project Features:**
- Responsive Layout
- Fixed Navigation
- Pop-up Modals
- Tab Panels
- Contact Form
- Scroll to Top

## **React-Icons**

`npm install react-icons --save`

The icons from this project can be found in the Feather or Heroicon sections of the [React-Icons]([url](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)) library.


## **Email Component**

`npm install @emailjs/browser --save`

The form modal of the contact section is setup using SDK and an email template from [EmailJS]([url](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/)).
